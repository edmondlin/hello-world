# Work at Home
I worked for Oracle for 19 years. The last 13 years, I worked at home, remotely from Taiwan. So yes, I like working at home with my time under my full control. Most importantly, I deliver while working with freedom. I am only a highly talented engineer but also a strongly self-motivated person, so that my organization approved the telecommute arrangement in the first place. I successfully accomplished all the assigned projects for 13 consecutive years. Even though my whole team was at Oracle HQ, the other side of Pacific Ocean, I never had any problem to communicate with the rest of team. One big challenge to work alone at home was no teammates around to help when I hit problems. My problem solving strength helped me overcome the challenge. 

After Oracle, I joined a semiconductor foundry in China. I worked as IT director. The company was at set-up stage. I hired the people and built up the IT team. I designed the MES (manufacturing execution system) and wrote the skeleton sample code for the fresh graduate engineers to follow. The work at the foundry was fun but I did not enjoy the life on the windy island in China. I quit the job.

Now, I built up a software development team in Taiwan. My team members include other Silicon Valley veterans and some university professors who work on computing theory/algorithm. My team’s focus is database and algorithm-involved (searching, routing, distributed computing and etc) software solutions and implementations. 

We hope to join TopTal to get challenging projects and contribute to the developer’s network.
